### 1. Introduction
The Book Rate App is a simple yet effective application designed to allow users to rate books based on their reading experience. Instead of requiring complex login procedures, the app focuses on simplicity and immediate feedback.

### 2. Features
User Registration: When a user opens the app, they will first be prompted to enter their name. This name is later used to sign their reviews.
Book Selection: After registration, the user is directed to a menu where they can browse and select a book they want to rate.
Book Rating: Once a book is chosen, the user has the option to give a rating from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest.

### 3. User Interface
The application is divided into three main parts:
Name Registration: A simple field where the user can enter their name.
Book Menu: A clear menu with available books. Here, the user can easily navigate and choose the book they want to rate.
Rating Scale: After selecting a book, the user is presented with a simple scale from 1 to 5, where they can click or tap on the rating they want to give.

### 4. Changes and Improvements
Transition to a simpler system: The initial version of the application laid the groundwork for users to create an account so they could log in again and sign reviews with this user instance. For the sake of simplicity, we moved away from this; now, a new user instance is created when entering a name, which is used to sign any reviews.
